In other words, your sample _is_ your population. It's worth noting that we're dealing with what Professor Spiegehalter describes on p. 92 of *AoS* as a **metaphorical population**: we have all the data, and we act as if the data-point is taken from a population at random. We can think of this population as an imaginary space of possibilities. \n","\n","If, however, you have sampled _from_ your population, you only have partial knowledge of the state of your population. In this case, the standard deviation of your sample is not an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation of the population, in which case you seek to estimate that population parameter via the sample standard deviation, which uses the $n-1$ denominator."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q1PNb5z34gNO","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Great work so far!

Sampling distributions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UOVRiIAg4gNQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\sigma_{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","where $\\sigma_{mean}$ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population (the population parameter)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4b0WZLbX4gNR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["This is important because typically we are dealing with samples from populations and all we know about the population is what we see in the sample.

Would we get the same result? Would we make the same claims about the general population?
